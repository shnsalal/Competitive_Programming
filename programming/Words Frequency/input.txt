Robots.txt is a text (not html) file you put on your site to tell search robots
which pages you would like them not to visit.
Robots.txt is by no means mandatory for search engines but generally search
engines obey what they are asked not to do.
It is important to clarify that robots.txt is not a way from preventing search 
engines from crawling your site
(i.e. it is not a firewall, or a kind of password protection) and the fact that
you put a robots.txt file is something like putting a note â€œPlease, do not enterâ€
on an unlocked door â€“ e.g. you cannot prevent thieves from coming in but the good
guys will not open to door and enter.
That is why we say that if you have really sensitive data, it is too naÃ¯ve to rely
on robots.txt to protect it from being indexed and displayed in search results.
